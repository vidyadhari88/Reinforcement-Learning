# Reinforcement-Learning

# This Project's main goal is to let agent learn the shortest path to the goal. In the environment the agent controls a green square, and the goal is to navigate to the yellow square (reward +1), using the shortest path. At the start of each episode all squares are randomly placed within a 5x5 grid-world. The agent has 100 steps to achieve as large a reward as possible. They have the same position over each reset, thus the agent needs to learn a fixed optimal path.
